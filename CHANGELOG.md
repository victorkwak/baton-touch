# Changelog

All notable changes to `baton` (crate `baton-touch`). Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); before 1.0, a breaking change bumps the minor version.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-11-13

### Changed

- Lane reuse: the `/baton` skill tells the lead to post follow-up work for a follower it just worked with in that follower's current lane (the lane of its latest message), under a new task slug, even for a different workstream. A new lane is only for parallel work, a machine with no recent session in a lane, or the human's request. Before, each new workstream got a new lane, so the human had to set up a new session on the other machine for every follow-up. `docs/design.md` follows it. No code change.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- **Idle limit**: a listening session stops listening after it has been idle (no turn) for one hour by default. The config's `idle` sets it per machine (`idle = "4h"`, `idle = "never"`); `baton on --idle 4h|never|default` sets it per session, kept through `baton off`. The human's next message in the session resumes listening, and the waiter then wakes for what arrived meanwhile. `baton on` prints the limit; `baton doctor` shows the machine's.
- `baton hook wait --timeout SECS`: the waiter learns its hook's timeout. Without the flag it assumes 3600, the timeout of a hook from earlier versions.

### Changed

- `baton init` prints the Stop hook with `"timeout": 604800` (7 days) and `hook wait --timeout 604800`, so an idle limit above one hour works. Apply it to `~/.claude/settings.json`: with the old hook, Claude Code still ends every waiter after an hour, and `baton doctor` warns.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- Handoff timing: the `/baton` skill tells the lead to post a plan as soon as the follower's items are unblocked (the human's decisions and the contract between the two sides: API shape, data formats, names, the branch and commit to start from), then do its own part in parallel, and to put the handoff right after the step that settles the contract in its task list, not at the end. Later changes the follower relies on go out as a reply in the task. `docs/design.md` follows it. No code change.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- Lane naming: one lane per workstream, one feature or problem each (e.g. `looks-share-sheet`), never a bare repo, platform or machine name (`myapp-looks`, `ios`, `mac`). The `/baton` skill now tells the lead to name lanes `<short repo>-<workstream>` and to reuse a lane only for the same workstream. Docs and README examples follow it. No code change.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- **Lanes**: named streams of work, so one machine can run several streams in separate sessions. See `docs/design.md`, "Lanes".
  - `baton post --lane L`. Later messages in a task, and replies, take the task's or the replied message's lane by themselves.
  - `baton on --lane L` binds a session to a lane; `--lane -` puts it back in the lobby. A bound session wakes only for its lane. A lobby session wakes only for a message that opens a new lane.
  - `baton inbox --lane L|-` keeps one lane.
  - `/baton` asks which lane a session works on; `/baton <lane>` binds it at once.
- Board rule `lane`: a handover or close-task must carry its task's lane, and a plain reply outside a task the lane of the message it answers.

### Changed

- `baton post --plan` needs `--lane`.
- `baton on` no longer wakes a session for every new message to its machine: only for its lane, or for a new lane in the lobby. Messages without a lane never wake a listening session; arming by task still wakes the session that posted, took or replied in that task.
- `inbox` and `wait` text output has a `lane` column at the end; `show` and JSON output carry `lane`.
- The wake line names the lane: `Board: actionable message <id> from <m>, task <t>, lane <l>. ...`

### Breaking

- Message files can carry a `lane` line. A `baton` older than 0.2.0 refuses such files as invalid and ignores them. Upgrade every machine together. Files without a lane parse on both versions.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-03

First release, tried on two machines.

### Added

- Board repo: append-only messages and status events in git, one file per record. A single branch works as a compare-and-swap: rules are re-checked against the fetched tip before every push.
- Rules: one plan per task and its sender leads, no new plan while an unanswered plan waits, status changes by the addressee only, `to: any` claimed by the first taker, `wontdo` needs a reply, handover and close-task from the lead, branch ownership by handover.
- Commands: `inbox`, `show` (bodies inside a nonce fence), `post`, `take`, `release`, `close`, `wait`, `tasks`, `human`, `init`, `doctor`.
- Secret scan on every post.
- Claude Code `Stop` hook (`baton hook wait`): polls the board remote every 30 s without tokens and wakes an idle session only for a message that needs it. `baton on` / `baton off` and the `/baton` skill.
- Notes sync for a git notes repo: `baton sync` and the idle sweeper `baton sweep`.
- Cargo package `baton-touch` (the name `baton` is taken on crates.io); the binary is `baton`.

### Removed

- The `PreToolUse` guard. `baton hook guard` is a no-op, so a leftover hook does not fail tool calls; `baton doctor` warns about one. `baton init` prints a deny rule for edits in the board clone instead.
